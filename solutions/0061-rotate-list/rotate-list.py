# Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
# Output: [2,0,1]
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 	0 <= k <= 2 * 109
#
