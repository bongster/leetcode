Topic 1.1
parallel Execution

use multiple resource, running task at the same time


Topic 1.2

memories already slower than cpus

waste a lots of the to spent for waiting memory
for solving that used a cached memory



Moore's Law

Predicted that transitor density would double every two years

Smaller transistors switch fater

Not a physical law, just an observation.

Exponential increase in density would lead to exponential increase in speed.


Topic 1.3

Power/Temperature Problem

High power leads to high temperature

Air cooling can only remove so much heat

===

Dennard Scaling.

Voltage should scale with transistor size.


Concurrency vs Parallism
